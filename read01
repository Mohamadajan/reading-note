- now I know what markdown mean and how I write text by using markdown also I discovered GitHub and how great new account , add new repository like a reading-note 
- when I am reading and see the difference between html and markdown the markdown its very easy way to style text on the web 
- this something what I learned in markdown today 
.if you want write text its very easy you just write without anything 
. Heading : you should add # before the world for example ; # heading 

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.
. lists : 

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
-Images : 

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![type of image](link of image)
-Links : 
[web name](the link)

-Tables 
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |
And here is A practical application of what I learned today : https://mohamadajan.github.io/reading-note/ (Links to an external site.)
